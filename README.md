# **<ins>MyFirstGameEngine</ins>**  
This repository features my first-ever C++ game engine built from scratch and an OIT Playground made using this game engine, showcasing my journey into game development.


**Note: The following projects have poor documentation of code, and doesn't reflect my ability to write clean documented code**

### **1. Personal C++ Game Engine**  

**Project I'm most proud of:**

This is my first C++ game engine, developed to explore and understand the of engine development. Creating this engine has truly been a learning experience, showcasing my growth and evolving coding style. Although I've moved onto developing a new engine based on DirectX 12, this project holds a special place in heart and showcases my passion for game development.

**Note: This is engine serves as a personal learning tool, tailored to my needs and preferences.** 

This game engine contains the following systems:  

- Multithreaded job system
- Event system
- Input system (mouse, keyboard, Xbox controller)
- Audio system (FMOD)
- Development console
- Buffer reader/writer
- Debug rendering system
- Parsers for XML, OBJ, TXT, and binary files
- TCP networking system

Custom Math and Physics library contains:

- Raycasts for AABBs, OBBs, capsules, cylinders, discs, spheres, lines, planes, and convex hulls
- General math utilities for dot product, cross product, projected lengths, easing functions, splines, interpolation, etc.



### **2. OIT Playground**

This project explores Order Independent Transparency (OIT) rendering techniques. It includes various demos and experiments that have helped me deepen my understanding of translucency rendering and GPU performance.  



### **3. Dynamic Environment**

This project explores various techniques for simulating dynamic environments using procedural generation and advanced rendering techniques. It features, a procedurally generated terrain developed entirely in shaders, a simulated grass rendering mode that integrates seamlessly with the terrain, enhancing the overall visual fidelity, and a test bed designed to explore and validate various assumptions regarding raymarching and signed distance fields (SDFs).
